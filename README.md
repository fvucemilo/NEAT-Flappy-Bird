# NEAT-Flappy-Bird

An artificial intelligence (AI) implementation for playing Flappy Bird using the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) Python module. Watch as the AI learns and trains itself to navigate through the challenging Flappy Bird game!

## Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Git (optional)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fvucemilo/NEAT-Flappy-Bird.git
   
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd NEAT-Flappy-Bird
   
3. **Install Dependencies:**
